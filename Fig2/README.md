- `2a.newick` is the simulated phylogeny with about one million cells, which seeded by 1,000 ancestors. Tag `O1_A2_C3` represents that the cell is the __C3__ descendant within the pool derived from the __A2__ ancestor of the __O1__ cell type.

- `2bc.RData` is the comparison between the TCA estimates and the actual number of progenitors under different sampling rate.

- `2d.RData` shows the effect of sampling strategy, including proportional sampling and fixed sampling.

- `2e.RData` shows the effect of the size of progenitor pool, ranging from 1,000 to 3,000.

- `2f.RData` shows the effect of the number of informative sites.

- `2g.RData` shows the effect of lineage invasion levels.

- `2hi.RData` is the results of dense sampling analysis for the focal cell type (__O1__ in this case).
