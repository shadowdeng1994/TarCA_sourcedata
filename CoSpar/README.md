Here, we briefly describe how LUG searching algorithm based on TCA applies to the dataset that records with static cell barcodes the in vitro differentiation process of mouse hematopoietic stem cells. Taking the single-cell transcriptome data with clonal information which is sampled at day 2 as an example, we demonstrate the acquisition of candidates for LUGs and the selection of significative LUGs.
